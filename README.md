## **How to Run Locally**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   cd yourrepository
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd client  # For the landing page
   npm install

   cd ../admin  # For the admin panel
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development servers:
   ```bash
   # Landing Page
   cd client
   npm run dev

   # Admin Panel
   cd ../admin
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Visit the following URLs:
   - Admin Panel: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Landing Page: `http://localhost:5173`

## **How It Works**

1. **Admin Panel**:  
   The marketing team uses the admin panel to manage content. They can:
   - Add new content blocks (e.g., banners, sections, testimonials).
   - Edit or delete existing content.

2. **Landing Page**:  
   The landing page fetches content from the backend dynamically. Any updates made in the admin panel are reflected immediately without a page reload.

## **Future Enhancements**
- Add user authentication for the admin panel.
- Introduce analytics for tracking visitor interactions.
- Support multilingual content.
